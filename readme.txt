This simple to use plugin automatically creates a Cli.gs short URL and sends a customizable Twitter message when saving a post.

== Description ==

*This plugin is no longer maintained!*

This simple to use plugin automatically creates a [Cli.gs](http://cli.gs/ "Cli.gs") short URL and sends a customizable [Twitter](http://twitter.com/ "Twitter") message when saving a post. Short URLs can be shown above and/or below posts and can be added to the page header for [auto-discovery](http://wiki.snaplog.com/short_url "Short URL Auto-Discovery").
